	<h1>SUPER MOM</h1>
	<p>
		Mom, you're a wonderful mother,
		So gentle, yet so strong.
		The many ways you show you care
		Always make me feel I belong.
	</p>
	<p>	
		You're patient when I'm foolish;
		You give guidance when I ask;
		It seems you can do most anything;
		You're the master of every task.
	</p>
	<p>	
		You're a dependable source of comfort;
		You're my cushion when I fall.
		You help in times of trouble;
		You support me whenever I call.
	</p>
	<p>	
		I love you more than you know;
		You have my total respect.
		If I had my choice of mothers,
		You'd be the one I'd select!
	</p>
